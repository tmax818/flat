# Notes

- Yeah...

- Yeah, so I want to make a centralized repo for all my notes for [Flatiron]().

[testData.js](testData.js) is what I am thinking...I don't know. I am thinking about a web interface that will clone repos into a directory like [forks]() 

- As I was typing testData.js, I thought about having a summary for each section or module...

- So, my forks are out of date...Surprise! 
- So...I am rethinking my approach.

- I want to have a collection of terms of sorts...I like the idea of having notes in my fork.
